## Files:

1. [Project RoadMap](https://github.com/kylenewm/Job-Search-Optimization/blob/main/Project_roadmap.png)  
2. [Notebook](https://github.com/kylenewm/Job-Search-Optimization/blob/main/JobSearchOptimizerEDA.ipynb) with all EDA and basic modeling
3. [Visuals](Visuals.ipynb) that did not load on GitHub
4. User interface with shiny for python (in progress) 
5. [SQL commands](https://github.com/kylenewm/Job-Search-Optimization/blob/main/Joining_Tables.sql)

## Problem: 
There is a lack of consistency for job postings in roles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, etc.
## Goal:

I wanted to gain exposure to all areas within data science (data engineering, data scientist, ML engineer, etc.) so I created a project that would allow me to do while also constructing a useful tool that otherr people can utilize during their job search. 

## Steps:
### Webscraping
1. Scrape data from Indeed using [Apify's](https://apify.com/hynekhruska/indeed-scraper) built in webscraper for Indeed
      - Make sure to set the job type to the jobs you are interested in (ex. Data Scientist) and set that as the starting point for the URL in apify
      - It may also help to use a secure VPN to deal with 403 errors. 
2. Download scraped data into a csv file and eliminate large row gaps or other critical errors that prevent dataset from uploading properly into DataBricks
### Setting up environment, uploading, and altering dataset
1. Connect to cluster through either (AWS, Google Cloud, or MicrosoftAzure) and upload files into Databricks using the UI 
      - When uploading files make sure to check the boxes enabling multi-line and first row headers
2. Run commands in [SQL file](https://github.com/kylenewm/Job-Search-Optimization/blob/main/Joining_Tables.sql) in Databricks
### Preprocessing, EDA, and Modeling
1. Follow along with ipynb file for preprocessing, EDA, and modeling
### Next Step:
Create a user interface that allows an individual to select one of the few thousands job postings and then display the results using Shiny for pyhton. 
### Resources to get started
Here is a link to a great [paper for text-based clustering techniques with large datasets](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40747-021-00512-9)

My personal favorite NLP tutorial: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/01/roadmap-to-master-nlp-in-2022/

A great website for finding pretrained models etc. They have awesome tutorials and solid documentation. https://huggingface.co/ 

If you are interested to dive further into HDBSCAN, I would read the [documentation] (https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
