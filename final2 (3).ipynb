After giving up, I tried to just classify on labels I created myself. I once again spent hours longer tring to do this. I tried reducing the scope again to gain a good sihloutte score for topic modeling. Unfortunately, I did not have the knowledge within NLP to do the data preprocessing. Even are receiving assistance, I realized clustering documents of the size I was working with was unrealistic. I tried using HuggingFace to help with implementation with new project ideas such as using zero-shot classification. However, the run time was way to slow.\n",
